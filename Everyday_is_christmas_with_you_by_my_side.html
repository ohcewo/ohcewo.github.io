        <p><span class=" fc-2nd">Dec 10, 2024 · </span> A holiday <b>bonus</b> should never be expected but it is standard in the nanny industry to do 1-2 weeks&rsquo; worth of pay as a holiday <b>bonus</b>. It is typically less if the nanny has only been with your family for a few months and on the higher end of that if they have been with you for several years.  <span class=" fc-2nd">Dec 8, 2023 · </span> Also remember, the <b>bonus</b> is considered taxable income and should be reported as such. In addition to how long a nanny has worked for you, the size of their <b>bonus</b> can also depend on their performance. When possible, exceptional care should yield a higher <b>bonus</b>. The final factor to consider is, of course, what you can reasonably afford.  <span class=" fc-2nd">Jun 4, 2020 · </span> 20. <b>Christmas</b> Ornaments. Give your <b>babysitter</b> a custom-made <b>Christmas</b> ornament and they&#39;ll remember you every year when they decorate their tree. I recommend including the names of your children and the year. Sentimental Gifts. If your <b>babysitter</b> is really close to your kids and family, a heartwarming sentimental gift might be appropriate.  <span class=" fc-2nd">Nov 29, 2024 · </span> Considering that a holiday <b>bonus</b> for a nanny is standard, you can factor this into your budget for in-home childcare. You could add it to your nanny contract or work agreement. It can state that you may offer your nanny a holiday <b>bonus</b> at your discretion. What about gifts other than a <b>bonus</b>? Gifts, in addition to a <b>bonus</b>, are always a great idea.  <span class=" fc-2nd">Nov 13, 2024 · </span> As the holiday season approaches, many families begin to think about how to show appreciation for the hard work of their nanny. One of the most common ways to do this is through a <b>Christmas</b> <b>bonus</b>. But what&rsquo;s the &ldquo;right&rdquo; amount, and is there a standard? Over my 20 years of experience as a nanny, and the placement manager at Kids and Kaboodles Nanny Agency I&rsquo;ve seen that <b>bonuses</b>, while ...  <span class=" fc-2nd">Nov 21, 2024 · </span> Whatever amount you choose, a <b>bonus</b> lets your nanny know they are appreciated and offers an additional incentive to continue working for your family. When to give your nanny a holiday <b>bonus</b>: Consider that the sooner you can give your nanny her holiday <b>bonus</b>, the sooner she can use it. We recommend giving your nanny her <b>bonus</b> around Thanksgiving.  <span class=" fc-2nd">Oct 14, 2022 · </span> What To Give Your Nanny. MONETARY GIFT IDEAS. An airline ticket to go visit family or friends during the holidays, most airlines have gift cards. Table for 2, buy a gift certificate at your favorite upscale restaurant to treat your nanny and guest of her choice to a fancy dinner out.  <span class=" fc-2nd">Dec 10, 2018 · </span> The final factor to consider is what you can reasonably afford. Since holiday <b>bonuses</b> are standard, it&rsquo;s a good idea to plan ahead and put money away throughout the year to cover the <b>bonus</b>, if needed. Along with the holiday <b>bonus</b>, it&rsquo;s typical for families to include a sentimental handmade card or gift from the children.  An au pair (a live-in caregiver from a foreign country who works through an au pair program) has duties very similar to a nanny. And just like a nanny, one week&rsquo;s pay is an appropriate <b>bonus</b>. A homemade gift or card from the kids is also appreciated. Who: <b>Babysitters</b> and Mother&rsquo;s Helpers.
